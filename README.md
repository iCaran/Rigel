# Rigel

Rigel is a full-stack social media platform designed to connect users through personalized content, real-time messaging, and robust profile management. This work-in-progress application leverages modern technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.IO to deliver an engaging, real-time user experience with a focus on tag-based content filtering and interactive chats.

## Overview

Rigel is designed to be a dynamic and personalized social platform where users can:
- Create and share posts enriched with images and tags.
- Filter posts based on their preferred and disliked tags using MongoDB aggregations.
- Manage their profiles, including bio, username, and tag preferences.
- Engage in real-time conversations via an integrated messaging system that leverages Socket.IO.
- Enjoy an evolving user experience that continuously adapts to their interests and social interactions.

This project is a work in progress and is actively being developed and improved. The core concept is to build a platform that feels both personal and interactive, enabling users to not only consume content but also interact through real-time messaging and tag-based content curation.

---

## Features

- **User Profiles:**  
  - Fetch, display, and update profile information (bio, username, profile picture).
  - Manage preferred and not-preferred tags to influence content filtering.

- **Post Feed:**  
  - Create posts with text, images, and tags.
  - Filter posts using MongoDB aggregations based on user tag preferences.
  - Mark posts as seen and handle pagination.

- **Real-Time Messaging:**  
  - Conversations are modeled using two collections: one for conversation metadata and another for individual chat messages.
  - Real-time chat functionality implemented with Socket.IO.
  - Conversation list displays the other party’s profile photo and username.

- **Tag Filtering:**  
  - Posts are filtered based on the user’s liked (preferred) and disliked (not-preferred) tags.
  - Utilizes MongoDB’s aggregation framework for efficient querying.

- **File Uploads:**  
  - Image uploads for posts and profile pictures handled via Multer.
  - Static serving of uploaded images from designated directories.

- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) used for secure authentication.
  - Protected routes ensuring that only authorized users can access certain endpoints.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - **React** with functional components and hooks

## Architecture & Data Models

### **Data Models**

1. **User:**  
   Contains user credentials, profile information (username, bio, profilePic), tag preferences (preferredTags, notPreferredTags), and other metadata.

2. **Post (Message):**  
   Stores post content, associated tags, image URL, author reference, and a map of users who have seen the post.

3. **Conversation:**  
   Represents a conversation between two users. Contains:
   - An array of participants (references to User documents).
   - Last message summary (content and timestamp).

4. **Chat:**  
   Represents individual messages within a conversation. Contains:
   - Reference to the Conversation document.
   - Sender, message content, timestamp, and an optional list of users who have read the message.

### **Architecture**

- **Server:**  
  The Express server is wrapped in an HTTP server and enhanced with Socket.IO for real-time communication. It handles API routes for authentication, profile management, posts, tag handling, and real-time chat messaging.
  
- **Client:**  
  A React-based frontend communicates with the backend via REST endpoints for initial data fetching and uses Socket.IO for real-time updates in messaging.

- **Real-Time Messaging Flow:**  
  When a user sends a chat message:
  - The client makes a POST request to the `/conversations/:id/chats` endpoint.
  - The server saves the message and emits a `newMessage` event via Socket.IO.
  - Other clients in the same conversation room receive the event and update their UI in real time.

## Installation & Setup

### **Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+ recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed and running
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### **Backend Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rigel.git
   cd rigel
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/rigel
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

4. **Run the Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### **Frontend Setup**

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Environment Variables

- **PORT:** The port on which the backend server runs.
- **MONGO_URI:** MongoDB connection string.
- **ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET:** Secret key used for JWT authentication.
- (Additional variables can be added as needed.)

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

- **Real-Time Messaging:**  
  While Socket.IO integration is in place, further improvements can be made to optimize reconnections and handle edge cases.
- **Optimistic UI Updates:**  
  Deduplication of messages and better error handling for optimistic updates in the chat interface.
- **Enhanced Tag Filtering:**  
  More sophisticated tag-based recommendations and post filtering based on user behavior.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:**  
  Refining the user interface for mobile responsiveness and overall design polish.
- **Security:**  
  Additional security measures such as rate limiting, input sanitization, and enhanced authentication flows.
