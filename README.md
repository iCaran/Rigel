# Mintaka – A Personalized Anime & Social Connection Platform

**Mintaka** is a dynamic web application that combines personalized anime recommendations with social interactions. Built with modern web technologies, it allows users to discover anime, interact through messaging, and express their interests via posts—while using cutting‑edge recommendation and tag filtering systems. **Note:** This project is a work in progress, and more features and refinements will be added in the future.

## Overview

Mintaka is designed to bring together users with a shared passion for anime. The platform provides personalized recommendations and allows users to create posts, chat in real time, and filter content based on their preferences. A sophisticated recommendation engine (initially implemented with Alternating Least Squares) boosts posts that match the user's preferred tags while filtering out content they dislike.

---

## Features

- **Personalized Anime Recommendations:**  
  - Uses user rating data and tags to generate personalized anime recommendations.
  - Boosts posts that match users’ preferred tags while filtering out not-preferred tags.

- **User Messaging System:**  
  - Real-time messaging powered by Socket.IO.
  - Supports conversations between users with notifications for new messages.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  - Fully responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS and custom styling.
  - Components like Left, Middle, and Right adjust seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

- **Tag Management:**  
  - Users can specify preferred and not-preferred tags.
  - The system fetches top tags and supports real-time tag search.
  - Future updates will also implement more advanced tag analytics.

- **Work in Progress:**  
  - The project is continuously evolving. New features (e.g., enhanced user profiles, additional post interactions, further customization of recommendations) are planned.

---

## Architecture

### Back-End

- **Node.js & Express:**  
  - The server is built using Express, providing RESTful endpoints for user authentication, profile management, messaging, and recommendations.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose:**  
  - MongoDB stores user, post, and tag data. Mongoose models define the schema for users, messages, and tags.
- **Socket.IO:**  
  - Enables real-time messaging between users.
- **Model Training:**  
  - Python scripts (using libraries like `implicit` for ALS) handle model training and are scheduled to run periodically.
  
### Front-End

- **React:**  
  - The client is built using React with React Router for navigation.
- **Tailwind CSS:**  
  - Custom responsive styles (including classes such as `middle`, `feeds`, and `feed`) ensure a fluid UI across devices.
- **Material UI Icons:**  
  - Icons from MUI are used throughout the app for a modern look and feel.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mintaka.git
   cd mintaka
   ```

2. **Install Server Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Client Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the server folder with the following variables:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mintaka
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

5. **Start MongoDB:**  
   Ensure MongoDB is running locally or update `MONGODB_URI` to your database server.

---

## Running the Application

### Server-Side

Start the Express server (from the server directory):

```bash
npm start
```

### Client-Side

Start the React development server (from the client directory):

```bash
npm start
```

### Model Training Scripts

The project uses two Python scripts for training recommendation models:

- **anime_recommendation_train.py** – Trains the anime recommendation model.
- **user_recommendation_train.py** – Trains the user similarity model.

These scripts are scheduled to run every hour using `node-cron` (see the server’s `server.js` for details). You can also run them manually:

```bash
python scripts/anime_recommendation_train.py
python scripts/user_recommendation_train.py
```

---

## Endpoints & API

### Authentication & Profile

- **POST /register** – Register a new user.
- **POST /login** – Login and obtain a JWT.
- **GET /profile** – Retrieve logged-in user’s profile.
- **GET /profile/:userId** – Retrieve a specific user’s profile.

### Messaging

- **GET /conversations** – Retrieve user conversations.
- **POST /conversations/init** – Initiate a new conversation.
- **GET /conversations/:conversationId/chats** – Retrieve chats for a conversation.
- **POST /conversations/:conversationId/chats** – Send a new message.
- **GET /messages/:position** – Retrieve a post for the given position (boosted with preferred tags).

### Tags

- **GET /tags/top** – Fetch top N tags (e.g., `?n=10`).
- **GET /tags/search** – Search tags by name (e.g., `?q=action`).

---

## Front-End Components

### Left Component

- Displays user profile information and navigation links.
- "Create Post" button focuses on the post input field on the Home page.
- Uses React Router for navigation.

### Middle Component

- Houses the post creation area.
- Contains a responsive textarea that auto-resizes and supports file attachments, tags, etc.

### Right Component

- Displays top tags as large, responsive bubbles.
- Includes a search bar for real-time tag search.
- Uses custom CSS classes (`right`, `messages`) to maintain layout consistency.

---

## Real-Time Messaging

- **Socket.IO Integration:**  
  The MessagesComponent establishes a WebSocket connection to handle real-time message events.
- **Joining/Leaving Rooms:**  
  When a conversation is selected, the client joins the corresponding socket room to receive live updates.
- **New Message Handling:**  
  Incoming messages are appended to the conversation in real time.

---

## Recommendation System

### Boost Matching Posts

- **Implementation:**  
  The `/messages/:position` endpoint uses an aggregation pipeline to calculate a match score based on the number of tags a post shares with the user’s `preferredTags`. Posts are then sorted by this score (and creation date) to boost matching content.
- **Customization:**  
  You can further tweak the ranking logic by adding weights or combining with other signals (e.g., post popularity).

---

## Tag Management

- **User Preferences:**  
  Users can specify `preferredTags` and `notPreferredTags` in their profile.
- **Top & Search:**  
  Dedicated endpoints and UI components allow users to view trending tags and search for tags in real time.
- **Future Enhancements:**  
  Plans include integrating tag-based notifications and personalized content filtering based on tag interactions.

---

## Future Improvements

Mintaka is a work in progress. Some planned enhancements include:

- **Enhanced Recommendation Engine:**  
  Incorporate hybrid methods and machine learning techniques to improve personalization.
- **Expanded Messaging Features:**  
  Richer message formatting, read receipts, and conversation threading.
- **User Profile Enhancements:**  
  Additional customization options, activity feeds, and social metrics.
- **Improved Tag Analytics:**  
  Better insights into tag usage, trending content, and user engagement.
- **UI/UX Refinements:**  
  Continued improvements in responsiveness, accessibility, and overall user experience.
